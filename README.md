# Urban Mapping

**Note: This project is in the _very_ early stages right now and not even close to a first release.**

A free and open-source mobile, desktop and web app to map your environment. It lets you mark different locations and add metadata to each entry in the form of text, images, timestamps etc. You can organize the entries in different lists.

One day you might even be able to share and collaborate on maps.

## Use cases and backstory

This app is a hobby project of a student from Berlin who has an autistic special interest in the amazing local graffiti art scene. I love spotting and collecting graffitis from different collectives in my everyday life. I also love data and started remembering and mapping out all the different spots where I discovered the graffitis of my favorite artists. But my head only has limited capacity. Thus came the idea for a digital solution that would let me easily map different locations in multiple lists (each for a given artist/collective) and add a picture and some other comments to each entry. I wasn't happy with Google Earths capabilities and couldn't find a better or any alternative really that ticks all my boxes. May this app allow everyone to easily map out their environment. Whether it's birds, art, nice park benches or whatever!
